InfraRedstone adds a new analog redstone system that avoid many of the problems with both vanilla redstone and common modded redstone replacements like Project Red or EnderIO conduits. It has four fundamental aspects:

- **User-friendliness**. If you know the mod, you should be able to look at a picture of a circuit to understand it.
- **Compactness**. The mod provides a set of built-in gates and modules to make building simple redstone circuits easier and open opportunities to make all-new circuits.
- **Flexibility**. Simple circuit pieces combined with 64 signal strengths and no signal decay means you can do even more with comparative logic, and convert it all to vanilla redstone when you're done.
- **Efficiency**. Only the gates and modules update ever; wires are just dumb blocks to connect modules. Few tile updates, so more server-efficient than vanilla redstone.
